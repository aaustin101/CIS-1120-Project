    <h2> Welcome to my website </h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Andrew Austin and welcome to my website! Whether you stumbled upon my website by mere chance, or you found my work somewhere, feel free to look around. But first, let me tell you a bit about myself. I am currently a New Media Major and Graphic design Minor at Molloy College. I aim to one day find a career in the realm of graphic design and/or social media marketing. On this webpage you can see some of the work that I have created during my college career. This features many different Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro projects that I have created. They showcase the skills I have learned so far in regards to creating content for different social media platforms for different purposes. I hope you enjoy everything you see! If you want to get into contact with me, my contact info and social media pages are down below.
